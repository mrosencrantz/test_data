To:      All BOREAS Investigators and Staff

From:    Jeff Newcomer, BOREAS Information Scientist
         [(301) 286-7858] [<A HREF="mailto:newcomer@ltpmail.gsfc.nasa.gov">newcomer@ltpmail.gsfc.nasa.gov</A>]

Subject: Basic Help Information for Accessing and Using the BOREAS System

Hopefully all of you received the mailing on October 18 regarding access to the
preliminary BOREAS data on the BOREAS system at GSFC.  Based on questions from
several of you, we have prepared the following help information to assist you with
retrieving data from the system and using other basic system functions.  If you
need further information that is not available on-line, please contact <A HREF="mailto:beth@ltpmail.gsfc.nasa.gov">Beth
McCowan</A>.

When you do a direct login to your account on BOREAS, you are presented with a
menu of possible commands.  These comands and the ones that follow allow you to
access the on-line BOREAS data, get help information, send email, access other
data bases, and exit.  Basic help information is available on each of these
commands.  Some further information to help you follows.

<HR>
<H4><A NAME="Password">Changing Your Password</A></H4>
In order to change your password, you need to enter 'EXIT' from the main menu.
This places you at the operating system '$' prompt.

The command to change your password is SET PASSWORD.  When changing your password
you will see the following series of prompts:
$SET PASSWORD
OLD PASSWORD:
NEW PASSWORD:
VERIFICATION:
The password entries will not be displayed to the terminal screen.

If you ever forget your password, please contact Beth McCowan for assistance.

<HR>
<H4><A NAME="BOREAS Menu">Getting Back Into the BOREAS Menu</A></H4>
To get back into the menu system from the operating system '$' prompt,
enter 'BOREAS'.

<HR>
<H4><A NAME="Terminal Type">Setting Your Terminal Type</A></H4>
Based on the keyboard mapping done between your terminal and the BOREAS system,
you may need to set the terminal type to properly use all the available features.
In order to change your terminal type, you will need to EXIT from the main menu
and then enter 'SET TERMINAL' at the operating system '$' prompt along with the
proper qualifiers.  Entering 'SHOW TERMINAL' will cause the operating system to
display how it is currently perceiving your terminal.  Detailed help on the SET
TERMINAL command is available from the operating system by entering 'HELP SET
TERMINAL' at the '$' prompt.  Your basic configuration should include:

a) Width: 80 characters per line
b) Device_Type: VT 100 or VT200 Series
c) Page: 24 lines per page
d) Parity: None
<HR>

<H4><A NAME="Dir Syntax">Directory Syntax and Changes on BOREAS</A></H4>
On BOREAS, the syntax for directories is: disk:[dir10.subdir11.subdir12...].

At the operating system $ prompt, the command to change your current directory
is SET DEFAULT followed by the directory name.  If your current directory was
DISK1:[DIR1] and you wanted to move to a directory on another disk device, the
command would be SET DEFAULT DISK2:[DIR2.SUBDIR2].  If you wanted instead to
move down the directory structure under DISK1:[DIR1] to the directory
DISK1:[DIR1.SUBDIR2.DATA], you would enter SET DEFAULT [.SUBDIR2.DATA].

To display your currently active directory, enter SHOW DEFAULT.

<HR>
<H4><A NAME="Text Editor">Using the BOREAS/VAX Text Editor</A></H4>
To invoke the text editor, you need to enter the command ED or EDIT followed
by a file name.  If the file exists, the first set of lines in the file will
be displayed to the screen.  If the file does not exist, you will see a screen
that looks like this:

Once in the editor, the arrow keys move the cursor in the expected directions.
Most of the functionality though is obtained through use of the keypad keys as
follows:

<H4><A NAME="FTP">Making an FTP Connection to Your User Account</A></H4>
Assuming that you have the appropriate FTP software, you can initiate an FTP 
connection to your user account on the BOREAS system, change your current
default directory to the BOREAS data areas, and pull files to your system.
The following is an example (with explanations) of an FTP session:

$ Ftp BOREAS.Gsfc.Nasa.Gov (INITIATE AN FTP SESSION TO BOREAS.GSFC.NASA.GOV)
