        news article in 2000 asserted that, &quot;For many years, the Holy Grail 
        of the display community has been the enabling of both very large-screen 
        and very small-screen high-resolution displays with optimal clarity, field 
        of view, and performance.&quot;<font size="1" style="vertical-align: super"> 
        (1)</font> Excessive size and the cost of existing liquid crystal displays 
        (LCDs) prevented having convergent devices such as personal organizers, 
        laptop computers, and portable phones in one unit. In the search for faster, 
        smaller, cheaper, and better displays, scientists turned to a new type 
        of liquid crystal--the ferroelectric liquid crystal (FLC). Displaytech 
        of Longmont, CO, could produce FLC chips, but it only could produce them 
        one at a time. With funding from the Advanced Technology Program (ATP), 
        however, Displaytech successfully developed technology to mass-produce 
        FLC display chips. This achievement increased image quality by 600 percent, 
        expanded product lifetime by 100 percent, and cut per-unit costs from 
        $6,000 to $160. The technology is now integrated into Samsung projection 
        TVs and JVC camcorder displays and will be commercialized in several other 
        products shortly. Displaytech's success has encouraged more than two dozen 
        U.S. firms to enter the Japanese-dominated display market.<br>

      LCDs Were Costly and Limited in Range<br>
      <br>
      </font></b></font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 
      1994, LCD technology used in televisions and computer monitors was not keeping 
      pace with the needs of emerging applications, such as high-definition televisions 
      (HDTVs), head-mounted virtual displays, and videophone wristwatches. At 
      that time, the manufacturing process was too expensive, and the LCDs were 
      incapable of handling extremely small or large displays. </font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">These 
      chips, manufactured one at a time, took an engineer several hours to build 
      and carried massive overhead costs that priced the equipment well out of 
      the range of the average consumer. <br>
      <br>
      The process involved implanting liquid crystals onto individual silicon 
      chips, inserting circuitry to control the &quot;on-and-off&quot; states 
      of the liquid crystal, and then coating the chip with glass for durability. 
      Moreover, as screens became larger, traditional LCDs could not pack enough 
      pixels into displays to meet the detail requirements of extremely small 
      or large displays. Overcoming the magnification problem was prohibitively</font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
      expensive, as each increase in screen size cost manufacturers approximately 
      $1 billion in development costs. Those costs could not be passed on to the 
      average consumer because of price sensitivity.<i><font size="1" style="vertical-align: super">(2)</font></i><br>
      <br>
      And, for converged personal digital assistant/laptop/cell phones, the displays 
      needed to be small, lightweight, detailed, and inexpensive. Smaller </font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">screens 
      needed small, plentiful pixels that are viewable at any angle from the compressed 
      display, a task that was impossible with traditional LCDs because of the 
      pixel requirement and the need to bounce light off a triad of red, green, 
      and blue light generators in order to show colors.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"></font><br>
      <br>
      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#990033"><b>Ferroelectric 
      Liquid Crystals Held Potential to Solve Problems </b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A new generation of 
      LCDs, displays using FLCs, had the potential to be manufactured in mass 
      quantities at affordable prices by placing the FLCs on an entire silicon 
      wafer and then cutting the wafer into individual chips at the end of the 
      process. This process could reduce costs by spreading direct labor costs 
      over hundreds of units rather 
      than just one. Before Displaytech's ATP-funded project began, projections 
      suggested that using FLCs could reduce the price of an LCD chip from thousands 
      of dollars to a much more affordable $100.<br>
      <br>
      </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#990033"><font color="#000000">These 
      chips consist of a fast light-modulating layer of FLCs that sits directly 
      atop a silicon very-large-scale integrated (VLSI) circuit active matrix 
      device. FLC/VLSI devices are smaller, faster, use less power, and can be 
      magnified to extremely large sizes without image degradation. FLC images 
      begin with voltages sent through the silicon circuitry. Silicon circuitry 
      routes the energy to the appropriate aluminum pixel pads sitting atop the 
      silicon. The pixel pad fires individual pixels made of FLC. Whereas traditional 
      LCDs could only enable a matrix of large pixels separated by relatively 
      large distances of circuitry, FLC displays operate with smaller pixels situated 
      much closer to one another. </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#990033"><font color="#000000">Therefore, 
      the FLC display can produce detailed images as small as the silicon chip 
      (about the size of a postage stamp) more quickly than do existing LCDs. 
      Moreover, when magnified, the images are still sharp at sizes needed by 
      HDTV technology. </font></font></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#990033"><font size="2"><b><font color="#990033" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">ATP 
      Funds New Production Method for FLCs<br>
      <br>
      </font></b></font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000">In 
      1994, Displaytech invented and first demonstrated FLC displays that were 
      compatible with large and small screens and were also faster than traditional 
      LCDs. Displaytech's FLCs displayed color without bouncing light off the 
      traditional </font></font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">red, 
      green, and blue triads and turned pixels on and off faster than did traditional 
      liquid crystal pixels. This development resulted in even higher image quality 
      and even faster image change speed. Although the FLC images were fast, the 
      one-at-a-time manufacturing process was still too slow.<br>
      <br>
      Displaytech devised a technically sound strategy for a new manufacturing 
      process that could reduce the net cost per unit by 99 percent and increase 
      the daily yield from 4 to 500 units per operator. The company approached 
      both private investors and the United States Army for funding. The Army 
      recognized the potential of Displaytech's manufacturing process, but made 
      no funds available for the project. Private sources of capital were reluctant 
      to fund the project because of the risks involved with investing in a proposed 
      method without a demonstrated manufacturing process in place. <br>
      </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To get past the technical 
      hurdles that discouraged potential private investors, Displaytech submitted 
      a single-company proposal to ATP's 1994 general competition to develop its 
      new manufacturing process technology. In ATP's peer review, potential economic 
      benefits appeared solid</font> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">and 
      the</font> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">engineering 
      plan was judged sound. In 1995, ATP awarded Displaytech $1.748 million for 
      a two-year project. The award attracted $1.5 million in matching funds from 
      Century Partners, an established venture capital firm that focused on new 
      technologies, and a private investor affiliated with Century. </font></p>

      Solves Technical Problems</font></b><br>
      <br>
      The first major technical barrier that Displaytech overcame was developing 
      the FLC array on a &quot;dummy&quot; silicon wafer to test the manufacturing 
      process. Silicon substrates are fairly expensive. Consequently, development 
      costs would have been prohibitive if Displaytech had used real silicon wafers 
      as it sought to develop a new manufacturing process. The company was unable 
      to find a source for FLC materials to be mounted on &quot;dummy&quot; silicon, 
      so it developed its own FLC </font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">materials. 
      </font></font></p>
    <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">These 
    materials resulted in higher conductivity and higher speeds than FLCs produced 
    from commercially available materials. <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Displaytech 
    overcame a second major technical barrier by developing an affordable mass-manufacturing 
    process for the FLC display chips. The company developed a process that yielded 
    35 percent usable FLC chips from</font> the dummy silicon wafer and then incrementally 
    increased the yield from there. Ultimately, the process was improved to the 
    point where final image quality increased 600 percent, product lifetime increased 
    100 percent, and costs declined from $6,000 per unit before ATP funding to 
    $160 per unit after funding. </font></font><br>
    <br>
    <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
    best-case scenario without ATP funding had been projected at $1,200 per unit. 
    Although the $160 per-unit cost ultimately achieved in the project did not 
    meet the pre-project estimate of $100 per chip, costs are projected <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">to 
    decline <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">further 
    as plant capacity increases. The company's third task was to develop approaches 
    for ramping-up the manufacturing process to produce high volumes of FLC displays. 
    As of early 2000, implementation of manufacturing improvements had <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">increased

      FLCs Are Changing Entire Industries<br>
      <br>
      </font></b>The postage-stamp-sized FLC chip, together with projection lens 
      technology also developed by Displaytech, is capable of displaying images 
      as small as the chip itself and as large as the industry demands, without 
      image degradation. In short, Displaytech appears to have found &quot;the 
      Holy Grail of the display community.&quot; <br>
      <br>
      The trade press lauded FLC displays as technology that will completely replace 
      cathode ray tubes and change the way the world uses visual images. <i><font size="1" style="vertical-align: super">(3)</font></i> 
      According to the press, the lighter, faster, better, and cheaper technology 
      may completely change the market price for flat-panel HDTVs, enable full 
      convergence of smaller machines, and spawn a new line of eyeglass-frame-mounted 
      personal displays. The FLC technology also has shown promise in the development 
      of optical memory systems that are faster, use less power, and are smaller 
      than current computer-based memory systems.<br>

      Alliances with Hewlett Packard and Miyota Result in Diversified Products<br>
      <br>
      </b></font>The manufacturing process for FLCs appeared so promising that 
      in 1995 Hewlett Packard (HP) approached Displaytech about forming a joint 
      venture. The result was the birth of LightCaster, a product series of Video 
      Graphics Array, eXtended Graphics Array, and Super-eXtended Graphics Array 
      postage-stamp-sized panels for the personal, projector, and high-resolution 
      markets. </font></p>
    <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Displaytech manufactures 
    the FLC, HP manufactures the silicon chip, and Miyota mass-produces the actual 
    displays. These displays are then shipped to original equipment manufacturers 
    such as JVC, Samsung, and Minolta. Samsung installs LightCaster into its Tantus 
    line of projection HDTVs. These HDTVs include both 43-inch and 50-inch screens 
    and are one-third the weight of other HDTVs. Each HDTV fits onto an 18-inch-deep 
    shelf and features 2.76 million pixels with 16.77 million color shades. <br>

      into Samsung projection TVs and JVC camcorder displays and will be commercialized 
      in several other products shortly.<br>
      </font><br>
      <font color="#990033"><b>Outlook:</b></font><font size="1"> The FLC manufacturing 
      process has the potential for extremely broad application across the electronics 
      industry. Inexpensive FLCs have the potential to improve displays in most 
      electronic equipment. Moreover, the technology could potentially spawn entirely 
      new products through convergence of old products and the development of 
      eyeglass-mounted computers and personal video displays. The outlook is excellent 
      for continued market success of existing products and commercialization 
      of entirely new products.<br>
